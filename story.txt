A wild donkey once lived in the woods. He had no friends and lived all alone. One day a jackal passing by saw the donkey. He went up to the donkey and said, “What is the matter? Why do you look so sad my dear fellow?" The donkey turned to the jackal and said, “I have no friends and am very lonely." The jackal then motioned the donkey to follow it. They went deep into the woods, about thirty minutes away from where they previously were. All of a sudden, the donkey started to hear music. The music got louder with each step until they both stepped into a clearing the donkey had never seen before.
