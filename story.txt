A wild donkey once lived in the woods. He had no friends and lived all alone. One day a jackal passing by saw the donkey. He went up to the donkey and said, “What is the matter? Why do you look so sad my dear fellow?" The donkey turned to the jackal and said, “I have no friends and am very lonely." The jackal then motioned the donkey to follow it. They went deep into the woods, about thirty minutes away from where they previously were. All of a sudden, the donkey started to hear music. The music got louder with each step until they both stepped into a clearing the donkey had never seen before. All around them were squirrels. Hundreds of them, all circled around an iPod playing music in the center of the clearing. The jackal and the donkey looked at one another, when suddenly the music stopped mid-song. The iPod died.
"What happened? Why does the music stop" asked the donkey, "the iPod died" said the jackal. "But I want to listen the music, it makes me happy" "But no music can play forever" said the jacal,"You cannot rely on music, you have to make some friends "

The donkey's face slid to a frown as he realized his life needed to change. Temporary things could not make his happiness last forever. He looked at the jackel and said "will you be my friend?"
